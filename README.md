# kworkflows

A small module adding versatile state/transition workflows to Django applications

kworkflows is inspired from xworkflows and its buddy django-xworkflows, two modules offering a good state/transition workflow framework for general Python and Django applications.

Our goal in this work is to offer some flexibility, especially regarding flow inheritance, i.e. the possibility to have "typed" workflows,
i.e. dynamically attach a workflow to an object according to the value of one or more fields of the object.
