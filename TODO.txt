sanity checks:
check transitions in workflow vs transitions in declard in underlying model

optionally raise if advance_state fails

add some docstrings and comments

add logging

add goto_state

allow multiple state fields per model

set auto_now in postgres if applicable
set choices in postgres if applicable

do automatic advance_state if transition is not declared in proxy ?
